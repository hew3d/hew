//! Snapping/inference engine: pure geometry queries over the whole scene.
//!
//! The SketchUp-feel half of the product (ARCHITECTURE.md, risk #2): tools ask
//! "the cursor is along this ray — where does the user *mean*?", and this
//! crate answers with a [`Snap`]: a position, why it snapped, and to what.
//!
//! Boundaries (DEVELOPMENT.md rule 1): UI-free, I/O-free, renderer-free. The UI
//! converts pixels to a [`PickRay`] + cone aperture and draws the cues; this
//! crate only does geometry. It reads kernel Objects but NEVER mutates —
//! inference queries against the whole scene, while geometry merging stays
//! within the active Object (ARCHITECTURE.md).
//!
//! # Priority model
//!
//! When several candidates fall inside the pick cone, the strongest
//! [`SnapKind`] wins (the enum's declaration order IS the priority order,
//! strongest first — `SnapKind`'s `Ord` reflects it and tools may rely on
//! that). Among candidates of equal kind, the one nearest the ray wins; ties
//! break toward the one nearest the ray origin (closest to camera).
//!
//! # Locking
//!
//! A [`SnapLock`] (shift-lock or arrow keys in SketchUp terms) constrains the
//! result to a line through the query's `anchor`. With a lock active, every
//! candidate is projected onto the locked line before ranking, and the
//! returned snap keeps the candidate's `kind`/`source` so the UI can still
//! say *why* (e.g. "on axis, from endpoint").
//!
//! M1 status: implemented with a linear scan over candidates. A spatial
//! index lives behind `InferenceScene` later; the API deliberately hides the
//! storage so the index strategy can change without touching callers.
//! Intersection snaps (`SnapKind::Intersection`) are M2 — the variant exists
//! but `resolve` does not emit it yet.
