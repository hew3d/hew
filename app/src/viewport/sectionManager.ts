 * sectionManager — session/app-layer state for the non-destructive Section
 * Plane (DESIGN §2). A `SectionPlane` is a plain data
 * record, exactly like the current editing context or camera state: created,
 * mutated, and dropped entirely in the app, never serialized to `.hew` and
 * never undo-wired (v0.3.0 is session-only — DESIGN §8). Exactly one section
 * exists at a time; placing a new one replaces the previous (DESIGN §1).
 *
 * This module is pure data/logic — no three.js, no DOM, fully testable in
 * Node/vitest. `SceneRenderer` (rendering) and `SectionPlaneTool` (gesture)
 * both consume `SectionPlane` records but own no section state themselves.

 * side the clip REMOVES (the face's outward normal — the side you clicked),
 * so geometry on the `+normal` side is cut away and the `-normal` interior
 * side is kept while `active` (DESIGN §2/§3; the clip plane the renderer
 * builds negates this normal — see `SceneRenderer.setSectionPlane`).
 * `active` toggles whether the plane currently clips — SketchUp's "Active
 * Cut" — independent of whether the section exists at all (a `null`
 * SectionManager.current means no section is placed). */
